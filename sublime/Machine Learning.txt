Machine learning workflows define the steps initiated during a particular machine learning implementation.||Gathering machine learning data|Gathering data is one of the most important stages of machine learning workflows. During data collection   you are defining the potential usefulness and accuracy of your project with the quality of the data you collect.|To collect data   you need to identify your sources and aggregate data from those sources into a single dataset. This could mean streaming data from Internet of Things sensors   downloading open source data sets   or constructing a data lake from assorted files   logs   or media.||Data pre-processing|Once your data is collected   you need to pre-process it. Pre-processing involves cleaning   verifying   and formatting data into a usable dataset. If you are collecting data from a single source   this may be a relatively straightforward process. However   if you are aggregating several sources you need to make that data formats match   that data is equally reliable   and remove any potential duplicates.||Building datasets|This phase involves breaking processed data into three datasets—training   validating   and testing:||Training and refinement|Once you have datasets   you are ready to train your model. This involves feeding your training set to your algorithm so that it can learn appropriate parameters and features used in classification.|Once training is complete   you can then refine the model using your validation dataset. This may involve modifying or discarding variables and includes a process of tweaking model-specific settings (hyperparameters) until an acceptable accuracy level is reached.|||Machine learning evaluation|Finally   after an acceptable set of hyperparameters is found and your model accuracy is optimized you can test your model. Testing uses your test dataset and is meant to verify that your models are using accurate features. Based on the feedback you receive you may return to training the model to improve accuracy   adjust output settings   or deploy the model as needed.||References:|.|https://www.run.ai/guides/machine-learning-engineering/machine-learning-workflow#:~:text=Machine%20learning%20workflows%20define%20which  evaluation%2C%20and%20deployment%20to%20production|  Training set|—used to initially train the algorithm and teach it how to process information.
