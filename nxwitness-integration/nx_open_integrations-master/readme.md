# Nx Meta VMP Open Integrations

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Introduction

This repository `nx_open_integrations` contains **Network Optix Meta Video Management Platform
open source integration examples** - the source code and specifications which show how to integrate
a third-party solution with the Nx Meta Video Management Platform (VMP) and thus all Powered-By-Nx
products, including Nx Witness Video Management System (VMS).

There are several branches in the repository corresponding to the VMS releases: vms_5.0, vms_5.1.
The master branch corresponds to the current development version of the VMS. Code examples in the 
branch do not necessary work with the release versions. 

Pay your attention to which branch you are about to use.
