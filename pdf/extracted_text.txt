There are two aspects to EPI, they are: Straight Through Processing. The process of uploading data that has been entered by advisers, from FPS to a Provider Data feed. The process of downloading and importing data extracted by the Provider to FPS This document contains information pertaining to the data feed interface Protocols for the transmission of EPI data feed files between a Provider and a FPS is not covered in this document.  Data transmission protocol is to be agreed between the Provider and the FPS Interpretation of EPI data imported by an FPS may vary between different FPS platforms.  Providers and FPS owners should ensure that data is interpreted and represented correctly. External Platform Interface Version 4.3 – Data Feed Page 8External Platform Interface - Data Feed The EPI version.4.3 data feed has been designed as an XML (eXtensible Markup Language).  This document describes the file format, naming convention and general business rules. NOTE: Failure to meet formatting rules outlined within this document may result in failure to import the file (in full or in part) into the Financial Planning Software.
